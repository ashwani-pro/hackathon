                       My solution, of your data is based on Jupyter (IDE), in Python Code formate using Machine Learning . The problem statement                        of given data set in which the , I use Multiple Regression Algorithms to solve the problem.
                       
                                        In the solving the problem , I have use to Polymal Regression and Multiple Regression to data mining
                       and data refining , the main reason to follow these algo is to provide the customer the best fit car accordding to their                          demand to fullfil their requirement .
                                        The workflow , I follow to solve the problem statement-
                                        * Load required packages
                                        * Import the data-set
                                        * Data pre-processing
                                        * Data exploration
                                        * Data modeling
                                        * Model evolution .
